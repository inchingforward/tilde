title: First VCR 
---

One night around 1986 when I was 12, my dad brought home our first VCR.  He was so proud of it.  It was a black front loader rather than "one of those cheap silver top loaders."  Watching movies whenever you wanted back then was still novel, so this was a BIG DEAL.

I was so stoked that I took a folder from school, Sharpied "Movies" on the front, and started numbering the lines of paper inside.  The entry at #1 was [Starman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088172/).  

That night we did the whole "theater in your home" deal -- made popcorn, turned out the lights, gathered around the sofa, and watched it as a family.  It was awesome.  

To this day I still can't watch the movie without feeling like an excited kid.
